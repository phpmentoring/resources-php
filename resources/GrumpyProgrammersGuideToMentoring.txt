The Grumpy Programmer's Guide To Mentoring

So you've decided you want to become a mentor to another programmer? Sharing
your skills and knowledge with everyone is awesome, so thanks for agreeing
to do something like it. Here are a few thoughts on how to make the 
experience awesome for both mentor and protégé.

#1. It's about making someone better

Clearly, you have a skill that is in demand and other people want to get
better at. So your entire approach should be aimed to helping that other
person build their skills up. Ask them questions about what they are
having trouble with, and show extraordinary patience in explaining topics
and concepts that might be obvious to you but completely new to them.

#2. Regular communication

I am currently mentoring 3 programmers on the finer arts of testing. I 
have a weekly voice-to-voice chat with them.

#3. But not too much communication

I tell my protégés that they can email me at any time and also give them
IM account names they can reach me at, but I also made it clear that I
have a day job and that will always take priority. Ad-hoc communication
channels are good, but set the expectation that these boundaries need
to be respected if this relationship is going to work out.

#4. Build a lasting friendship

In my talks I am focusing on helping them out with their testing skills
but also becoming their friend in the process. The relationship between
mentors and protégés can be one that lasts long after they are no longer
actively working through these problems together. Learn about people
and their lives outside of coding, you'd be surprised what could happen.
