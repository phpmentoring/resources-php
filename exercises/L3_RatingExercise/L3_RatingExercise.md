Level 3 Rating Exercise
-----------------------

Write a function that generates a random rating from 0 to 5 and outputs the following strings (in place of star images) in a single row, as required, to represent the rating:

'Full Star',
'Partial Star',
'Empty Star'

Append the randomly generated rating number to the string, in parenthesis, to aid testing.

##Sample output:

    Full Star  Full Star  Full Star  Partial Star  Empty Star (3.2)

##Additional:

If you know HTML, output `<img>` tags instead of strings, using the star images provided in the assets directory.
